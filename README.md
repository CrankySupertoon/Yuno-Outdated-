# I'm archiving this project in favor of my new [Discord Bot Template 2](https://github.com/zfbx/Discord-Bot-Template-2) as this project has some issues and is quite old at this point. The new project makes use of a framework that handles a lot of stuff better than I did in this project. please check it out.

## About
Meet Yuno, a discord bot built to be modular and easy to expand upon through Javascript using Discord.js. This project is the evolution of a previous project named Kuroyukihime that was my first big jump into node.js. This project is very special to me and used by myself aswell as many of my friends. I try my best to add features that are requested but I'm just one person so it might take me a little while depending on the complexity or I could do it in 5 minutes. If there's anything you would like to see request it [here](https://github.com/zfbx/Yuno/issues/new)

### Features
**Event Logging**

create a private channel and type `.logchannel` for Yuno to use that channel to log all events that happen on the server like new members, deleted message, role changes, etc.

**Auto Role**

Give a specified role to new users automatically when they join using `.autorole RoleName`. very useful for sorting users into categories above the bots for example.

**Twitch Live alerts**

Want a certain twitch stream to alert in a channel when it's live with a preview, title and current game? Just type `.twitch TwitchChannelname` in the channel you want alerts and Yuno will monitor that for you!

**Accept Terms for Role**

If you want to protect your server more from bots or force people to read and accept rules before gaining access to another area you can set up a role with `.termsrole RoleName` and when the user types `.accept` they will be given the role set and their message will be deleted keeping the terms and conditions channel nice and clean for you.

**For the rest of the features check out the [Command List](https://zfbx.github.io/Yuno/)**

## Who Is Yuno?
Yuno (Yuno Gasai) is base off a character from an Anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Honestly I just really like the character and thought she'd be a great theme for the discord bot :)
